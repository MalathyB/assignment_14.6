1. Explain what is Thrfit

* Thrift is an interface definition language and binary communication protocol that is used to define and create services for numerous languages
* It is used as a remote procedure call (RPC) framework and was developed at Facebook for "scalable cross-language services development"

2. Explain what is REST

* REST is an architectural style which is based on web-standards and the HTTP protocol.
* REST was first described by Roy Fielding in 2000. 
* In a REST based architecture everything is a resource.
* A resource is accessed via a common interface based on the HTTP standard methods.
* In a REST based architecture you typically have a REST server which provides access to the resources and a REST client which accesses and modifies the REST resources.

3. What is bulk import in Hbase

* Bulk import is the process of preparing and loading HFiles (HBase’s own file format) directly into the RegionServers, thus bypassing the write path and obviating those issues entirely. 
* There are two steps involved in Bulk Import
           => Preparing Data (HFiles) using Map/Reduce
           => Importing Prepared Data into HBase table


4. What is meant by a work flow and what is an oozie workflow

* WORKFLOW:
   Workflow is the series of activities that are necessary to complete a task.
   A workflow consists of an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of business activity enabled by the systematic organization of resources into processes that transform materials, provide services, or process information.

* OOZIE WORKFLOW:
   Oozie is a server based Workflow Engine specialized in running workflow jobs with actions that run Hadoop Map/Reduce and Pig jobs.
   Oozie is a Java Web-Application that runs in a Java servlet-container.
   Oozie workflow actions start jobs in remote systems. 
   Oozie workflows contain control flow nodes and action nodes.

5. How can you track a Oozie job

* Jobtarcker is used to track a oozie job

6. What kind of jobs can be scheduled with Oozie

* There are two basic types of Oozie jobs:
      => Oozie Workflow jobs are Directed Acyclical Graphs (DAGs), specifying a sequence of actions to execute. The Workflow job has to wait
      => Oozie Coordinator jobs are recurrent Oozie Workflow jobs that are triggered by time and data availability.

7. What is meant by oozie co-ordinator and how it is useful

* Coordinator applications allow users to schedule complex workflows, including workflows that are scheduled regularly. 
* Oozie Coordinator models the workflow execution triggers in the form of time, data or event predicates.
* The workflow job mentioned inside the Coordinator is started only after the given conditions are satisfied.
